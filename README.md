- Game state management
  - Bike position and movement
  - Building/Pokemon locations
  - Traffic positions
  - Objective progress

### Game State
- Bike position and speed
- Building locations and types
- Pokemon spawn points
- Traffic positions and patterns
- Objective completion status
- Player connection status
